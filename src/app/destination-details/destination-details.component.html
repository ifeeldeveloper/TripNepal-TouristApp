    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">The Dodhara Chandani Bridge (Nepali: दोधारा चाँदनी पुल), commonly known as Mahakali Bridge,
         is a suspension bridge for pedestrians and at this point only about 1452.5 m long over Mahakali River in the far west of Nepal. 
         One of the longest Multi-span Pedestrian Bridges in Nepal is located in the Kanchanpur district in the Mahakali zone in the 
         Far-Western Province, Nepal. It connects the two villages Dodhara and Chandani separated by the Mahakali River in Kanchanpur District. 
         The bridge in the Mahakali Zone Management connects the Nepalese territories near Indo-Nepal border cut off by the river.

        The bridge is located about 12km Southwest of Bhimdatta Municipality (until 2008 known as Mahendranagar), 8  km below the 
        Mahakali Dam and 5.5 km south and below the Indian. South and downriver is the Indian border around 11.4 km away</p>
        <p class = "text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8" >
            The Dodhara Chandani Bridge is a sequence of four suspension bridges with eight pylons, which are 
            anchored to large anchor blocks on both banks as well as three common anchor blocks in the river bed. 
            The lands between the 32.72-metre-high (107.3 ft) pylons have a wingspan of 225.40 m, the webs between 
            the anchors and the pylons have a wingspan of almost 70 meters. The bridge segments are curved slightly upwards. 
            The result is a series of arches of spans of 70 + 225.40 + 70 + 70 + 70 + 70 + 225.40 + 225.40 + 70 + 70 + 70 + 225.40 
            with a total length of 1452.96 m plus of approximately 20 m long anchor blocks on the banks.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">

The bridge consists of the steel pylons and essentially of wire ropes. The hangers are thin metal rods,
 which are connected to each other with eyes. The 1.60-metre-wide (5.2 ft) bridge deck is a sturdy metal grille. 
 On both sides serve ropes as handrails, which are connected by wire mesh with the bridge deck. Diagonal cables 
 between the railings and the underlying longitudinal cables are used for stiffening, as well as some stay cables 
 of the pylons for the bridge deck. Side, anchored in the riverbed ropes dampen fluctuations.

The bridge is designed as a pedestrian bridge, but bicycles and motorcycles can use the bridge as well. 
There is enough room so that motorcycles can pass even if they are fully loaded. All traffic travels on 
the left-hand side, as everywhere else in Nepal
